# Update genome collection
Python script (>3.8) created to download and update a collection of genomes based on a dynamic list of taxa.

It is useful if you have to manage a huge collection of genomes that needs a constant update.

To run it in your computer, download the files 'update_genomes.py' and 'taxons.txt' saving them in the same directory.

The file 'taxon.txt' can be modified including or removing names according to the user's needs.

## Running the command-line version:

Open a console and go through the repository where you have both files.

	$ python update_genomes.py

## Running update_genomes.exe version:

Place the files 'update_genomes.exe' and 'taxons.txt' in the same directory and go into it.

	double-click on update_genomes.exe

Wait a few minutes (it depends of your list) and 'Voil√†!'.
